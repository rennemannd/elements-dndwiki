            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Stonepeople, true to their name, are humanoid look-a-likes that are made of inorganic stone material. They are very similar to gargoyles and living statues in form, but have more of a will and consciousness of their own in comparison. Where the eyes are tend to be two holes from which it is believed whatever essence animating them can "see" out of. Despite being stone, they can move rather fluidly and at a decent speed if they get a running start. Their chiseled bodies are almost always carved to resemble powerful warriors with great muscles and physique. As their body is hard as it is, few ever take to wearing armor. In fact, some just chisel designs on their bodies, as they cannot feel pain.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Stonepeople are believed to be a denizen from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Following the Spellplague, when the planes collapsed into each other, they came to the Material Plane and mainly occupied places like abandoned mines or ruins. For a while, they were regarded as some menace since they could hide as statues in plain sight and this scared a lot of people. However, their luck changed somewhat when they began cooperation with dwarves, usually acting as guards along dangerous mining routes. As such, they now are better known sentinels and guardsmen for hire, and are accepted as such throughout most of the places they frequent.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Back in the Elemental Plan of Earth, the stonepeople functioned like the humans of that society. They raised xorns and xavers and also traded with occasional business travelers to the realm, trading with them for gems and such. Now stuck in the Material Plane, they have come to adapt more to beings which are "squishier" than the beings of earth and metal they are used to. As they do not have a firm grasp on agriculture with normal plants and animals, they often just do jobs for others, selling off their mighty strength and endurance.</p>
            <h4>Stonepeople NAMES</h4>
            <p>Stonepeople are usually named after different types of stone. Their bodies are usually chiseled in the form of a male or female, but other than that, they behave relatively similar. Females sometimes have names after gemstones rather than non-lustrous minerals.</p>
